There is a bug (https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/issues/675) in Rails 4.2.4, which won't support MySQL2 0.4.x versions, so when after creating a project,
 - Type the command -  
        gem uninstall mysql2 -v 0.4.2
 - And give the following command -
        gem uninstall mysql2 -v 0.3.18
 - Go inside the new project folder
 - open gemfile
 - remove the line gem 'mysql2' and replace that with below line,
        gem 'mysql2', '~> 0.3.18'
